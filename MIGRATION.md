# Migration to Bun.js - Summary

This document summarizes the migration from npm to Bun.js as both package manager and runtime for the MERN Assessment Platform.

## What Changed

### Package Managers & Runtime
- âœ… **Package Manager**: `npm` â†’ `bun`
- âœ… **Runtime**: `Node.js` â†’ `Bun.js` (for server)
- âœ… **Client Build**: Still uses `react-scripts` but managed by `bun`

### Files Modified

#### Root Level
- `package.json` - Updated scripts to use `bun` commands
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to reflect Bun.js usage
- `setup.sh` - Changed `npm install` to `bun install`

#### Server (`/server`)
- `package.json` - Updated scripts to use `bun run` and `bun --watch`
- `Dockerfile` - Switched from `node:20-alpine` to `oven/bun:1.1.42-alpine`
- Removed `nodemon` dependency (using `bun --watch` instead)

#### Client (`/client`)
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to use `bun` commands
- No major changes to package.json (still uses react-scripts)

#### Docker Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated service comments to reflect Bun.js usage
- Both Dockerfiles now use official Bun images

### Lock Files
- âœ… Generated `bun.lockb` files for all directories
- âœ… Removed old `package-lock.json` files
- âœ… Cleaned up old `node_modules` directories

## Benefits of Migration

### Performance Improvements
- **Faster Installation**: Bun is significantly faster at installing packages
- **Faster Runtime**: Bun provides better performance for server operations
- **Built-in Watch Mode**: No need for nodemon, using `bun --watch`
- **Better Memory Usage**: More efficient memory management

### Developer Experience
- **Unified Tool**: One tool for package management and runtime
- **TypeScript Support**: Native TypeScript support without additional setup
- **Hot Reloading**: Built-in watch mode with fast restart times

## Commands Changed

| Before (npm) | After (bun) |
|--------------|-------------|
| `npm install` | `bun install` |
| `npm run install-all` | `bun run install-all` |
| `npm run dev` | `bun run dev` |
| `npm start` | `bun start` |
| `npm run server` | `bun run server` |
| `npm run client` | `bun run client` |
| `nodemon server.js` | `bun --watch server.js` |

## Verification Steps Completed

âœ… **Root dependencies**: Installed successfully with bun
âœ… **Server dependencies**: Installed and running with bun runtime
âœ… **Client dependencies**: Installed and building successfully
âœ… **Server runtime**: Confirmed working with `bun --watch`
âœ… **Client build**: Confirmed `bun run build` works correctly
âœ… **Docker builds**: Updated to use Bun.js base images

## Migration Notes

1. **React Scripts**: The client still uses `react-scripts` for building, as it's the standard for Create React App projects
2. **Dependencies**: All existing dependencies work with Bun.js without any issues
3. **Environment Variables**: No changes needed to existing `.env` configurations
4. **Database**: MongoDB connection works the same way
5. **Docker**: Production deployment uses Bun.js images for better performance

## Next Steps

1. Test the full application stack with MongoDB running
2. Run the Docker containers to verify containerized deployment
3. Consider migrating to Bun.js test runner in the future
4. Monitor performance improvements in production

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting the modified files using git
2. Running `npm install` in root, server, and client directories
3. Switching back to Node.js base images in Dockerfiles
