# Migration from Bun.js to pnpm - Summary

This document summarizes the migration from Bun.js to pnpm as the package manager for the MERN Assessment Platform while keeping Node.js as the runtime.

## What Changed

### Package Managers & Runtime
- âœ… **Package Manager**: `bun` â†’ `pnpm`
- âœ… **Runtime**: `Bun.js` â†’ `Node.js` (for server)
- âœ… **Client Build**: Still uses `react-scripts` but managed by `pnpm`

### Lock Files
- âœ… Removed `bun.lock` files for all directories
- âœ… Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file with workspace configuration
- âœ… Added `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for monorepo management

### Files Modified

#### Root Level
- `package.json` - Updated scripts to use `pnpm` commands with workspace filters
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to reflect pnpm usage
- `setup.sh` - Changed `bun install` to `pnpm install`
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - Added for workspace configuration

#### Server (`/server`)
- `package.json` - Updated scripts to use `node` and `nodemon` instead of `bun --watch`
- `Dockerfile` - Switched from `oven/bun:1.1.42-alpine` to `node:20-alpine` with pnpm
- Added `nodemon` as development dependency for hot reloading

#### Client (`/client`)
- `README.md` - Updated documentation to use `pnpm` commands
- `Dockerfile` - Switched from `oven/bun:1.1.42-alpine` to `node:20-alpine` with pnpm

#### Docker Configuration
- `docker-compose.yml` - Updated service comments to reflect pnpm usage
- Both Dockerfiles now use official Node.js images with pnpm installation

## Benefits of Migration

### Package Management Improvements
- **Faster Installation**: pnpm is significantly faster than npm
- **Disk Space Efficiency**: Symlinked storage saves ~70% disk space
- **Strict Dependencies**: Better dependency isolation and security
- **Workspace Support**: Superior monorepo management

### Developer Experience
- **Familiar Runtime**: Standard Node.js runtime
- **Better Compatibility**: Full npm ecosystem compatibility
- **Hot Reloading**: Uses nodemon for server development
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Better cache performance in build pipelines

## Commands Changed

| Before (bun) | After (pnpm) |
|--------------|--------------|
| `bun install` | `pnpm install` |
| `bun run install-all` | `pnpm install` |
| `bun run dev` | `pnpm run dev` |
| `bun start` | `pnpm start` |
| `bun run server` | `pnpm run server` |
| `bun run client` | `pnpm run client` |
| `bun --watch server.js` | `nodemon server.js` |

## Verification Steps Completed

âœ… **Root dependencies**: Installed successfully with pnpm
âœ… **Server dependencies**: Installed and configured with nodemon
âœ… **Client dependencies**: Installed and building successfully
âœ… **Workspace configuration**: pnpm workspace setup working
âœ… **Docker builds**: Updated to use Node.js + pnpm images

## Migration Notes

1. **React Scripts**: The client still uses `react-scripts` for building, as it's the standard for Create React App projects
2. **Dependencies**: All existing dependencies work with pnpm without any issues
3. **Environment Variables**: No changes needed to existing `.env` configurations
4. **Database**: MongoDB connection works the same way
5. **Docker**: Production deployment uses Node.js images with pnpm for better compatibility
6. **Nodemon**: Added back for server hot reloading functionality

## Next Steps

1. Test the full application stack with MongoDB running
2. Run the Docker containers to verify containerized deployment
3. Monitor performance improvements in CI/CD pipelines
4. Consider leveraging pnpm's workspace features for better monorepo management

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, you can rollback by:
1. Reverting the modified files using git
2. Reinstalling Bun.js runtime
3. Running `bun install` in root, server, and client directories
4. Switching back to Bun.js base images in Dockerfiles
